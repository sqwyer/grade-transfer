# General Information
All todos are ranked by priority, the higher the lower the integer the more prioritized a task is. For example a task ranked as priority `1` would be considered extremely important and should be worked on as soon as possible. The lowest integer a task can be is `1`, the highest is `10`. When contributing, determine where your task(s) fall based on other tasks' priorities and then at your own discretion. Also ensure that you are following the same format as the Example Tasks below. When you have created your task, please put it in the list so that it is ordered (least to greatest).

### Example Tasks
- `1)` **Create contact API**: Create an API to contact the database.
- `3)` **Update all READMEs**: Make all README files more helpful and informational.
- `3)` **Move all CSS to the proper files**: Move CSS elements that should be in other files to the local where they should be. (ie. styles/index.css:a{} to styles/base.css:a{})
- `5)` **Rewrite server/server.js**: Rewrite the main server file to be more contributor-friendly.

> **Note:** If multiple tasks have the same priority ranking, put them in order of most priority to least priority of your opinion.

# Todos
> Currently this file is just a boilerplate and there are no active todos.
