# General Information
All todos are ranked by priority, the higher the lower the integer the more prioritized a task is. For example a task ranked as priority `1` would be considered extremely important and should be worked on as soon as possible. The lowest integer a task can be is `1`, the highest is `10`. When contributing, determine where your task(s) fall based on other tasks' priorities and then at your own discretion.

# Todos
> Currently this file is just a boilerplate and there are no active todos.
